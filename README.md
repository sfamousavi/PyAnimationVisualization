![](https://github.com/sfamousavi/PyAnimationVisualization/blob/main/PyAnimationContest_Gif.gif)

This repo is a simple Python code on data analysis and visualization with matplotlib animation library. 


**Here is the story of this example:**

Three games launched at different time: Game1 launched at 2021-01-06, Game2 launched at 2021-01-29 and Game3  launched at 2021-02-22. 
I want to investigate the process of gamers starting playing each game. How fast each game obtained its gamers and how common are gamers between games. 

I used two plots to visualize the results:
* Bar plot to show number of gamers for each game during the time
* Venn plot to show logical relationships between  collection of gamers sets
